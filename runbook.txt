PREREQUISITES:
Nix
Python 3.11 or higher
A working PostgreSQL instance containing a database called "lexdb", owned by "lexdba"

To set up the tooling environment (in a local context) and run the data pipelines:

 - clone the repo
 - issue "nix-shell" to install the system dependencies
 - issue 
    "poetry install"

    and then

    "poetry shell" 
    
    to install the Python dependencies and start the virtual environment.

 - set the necessary environment vars: 

	PYTHONPATH must include the repository root directory. ( export PYTHONPATH=`pwd` )
   LEX_HOME (must be set to the repo root)
   LEX_DB
   LEX_DB_HOST
   LEX_DB_PORT
   LEX_DB_USER
   LEX_DB_PASSWORD
   PGPASSWORD should be set to the same value as LEX_DB_PASSWORD.


Then, at the shell prompt, issue:

 make <pipeline-name>

 where <pipeline-name> is the name of a make target, to run the code.

 Run the init-dirs target first to create all the temporary directories the project will need.

+ Makefile instrumentation: "makeblocks"

The Makefile may contain some comments which contain a particular syntax of the form:

+open-varblock(...)
+open-cmdblock(...)

and so on. These comments are part of the data pipeline testing and instrumentation system. Do not alter or remove them
unless you know what you are doing.
